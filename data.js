We had a supply chain problem which is now been solved and have many containers on their way to both of our warehouses.  \n\nWe will have in stock in VA 1/6bbls at $76 each with American Sankey MicroMatic drop in valves and will be able to ship mid July. Over 200 keg orders receive a $2 per keg discount. I recommend to pre-order your kegs as early as possible to ensure they are available when you need them at this price. Quote is valid for one week due to the stainless steel price spike. ",
