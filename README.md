Frontend Developer Test
=============

You have been given a one-page app which allows an end-user to browse through their requests, the matched suppliers for each request, the quotes submitted by each supplier, and the messages exchanged between the end user and each supplier. 

Goals
=============
Your impoved app should achieve the following goals (in order of importance): 

1. Present the information and create a user experience that is most helpful and easy to use for the end user

2. Alert users to look at unviewed messages and quotes 

3. Get users to provide feedback on quotes 

4. Responsive design for multiple device types and screen sizes


Criteria
=============
You will be evaluated on the following criteria (in order of importance):

1. Achievement of the general goals

2. CSS and HTML style 

3. Javascript style 



Getting Started and Submitting
=============

1. To get started, fork this repo into your own github account or download the contents to your local. When you're done with the exercise, email the forked repo or your completed code to jie@kinnek.com

2. You will be evaluated by what you are able to do within 3 hours. Commit and push your code to your forked repo before or at the 3 hour mark. If you run out of time and need to quickly or complete something, you can make a separate push after the 3 hour push.



Guidelines
=============

1. You may import / remove / replace any generally available open source library.

2. You may modify and rewrite any portion of any file in the repository except for data.js which you may not modify.

3. You may consult any online resource (such as Stack Overflow) but you may not solicit help or advice from any human being. 

4. A simple jQuery / underscore based app has been written for you. You can add to it or even re-write it in a framework of your choice. However, keep in mind that you will be primarily evaluated on the design / UX / UI / HTML / CSS - not on the elegance of the javascript code.
